## FAQ
### Where to get a SteamAPI key?
All use of the Steam Web API requires the use of an API Key. You can acquire one by [filling out this form](http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey). Use of the APIs also requires that you agree to the [Steam API Terms of Use](http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apiterms).

### Where to get the SteamID64?
The script automatically obtains the 64-bit Steam key based on your profile name, but you can also retrieve it yourself. Just add `?xml=1` after your profile name, for instance http://steamcommunity.com/id/YOURPROFILENAMEHERE/?xml=1 and get the key inside of `<steamID64></steamID64>`.

### I already own the game but it still isn't highlighted as "In library"
The games list is updated once per day maximum and the parser might/will miss games that are spelled differently than the actual Steam name, sorry about that. Want to improve that? Check out https://github.com/petetnt/neogaf-monkeybot/issues/3!
